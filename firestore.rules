/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model for the Chipukizi Hub application, balancing public accessibility with administrative control and user-specific data ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Events: Publicly readable, managed by admins.
 * - Users: Each user can read/write their own profile data.
 * - Admin Roles: Existence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId} grants admin privileges.
 * - Services: Publicly readable, managed by admins.
 * - Bookings/Contacts: Public can create, admins manage.
 * - Gallery: Publicly readable, managed by admins, with user-generated likes/comments.
 * - Suggestions: Created by users, managed by admins.
 * - Resources: Readable by authenticated users, managed by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Events and Gallery items are publicly readable to maximize engagement.
 * - User data is private; users can only access their own information.
 * - Admin privileges are granted through the /roles_admin collection.
 * - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented for administrative tasks.
 * - Data validation is minimized for rapid prototyping but critical authorization checks are performed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `createdByAdminId` field on `Event`, `GalleryMedia`, and `Resource` documents enables efficient admin-only write rules without requiring additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly readable data (Events, Gallery) is stored in top-level collections to simplify read access.

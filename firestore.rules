/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Chipukizi VOD Cooperative Society.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model, balancing public accessibility with administrative control and user-specific data isolation.
 * It prioritizes preventing unauthorized data modification and ensures data integrity.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Stores event details, with public read access for published events and admin-only write access.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles, accessible for reading by the user themselves and admins. User creation is restricted to the user's own ID. User roles cannot be modified by the user.
 * - `/roles_admin/{userId}`: Documents that, when present, grant a user admin privileges.
 * - `/services/{serviceId}`: Stores details about offered services, publicly readable but only writable by admins.
 * - `/bookings/{bookingId}`: Stores service booking inquiries, creatable by the public but manageable by admins.
 * - `/contacts/{contactId}`: Stores contact form submissions, creatable by the public but manageable by admins.
 * - `/gallery/{mediaId}`: Stores gallery media items, publicly readable and admin-writable.
 * - `/gallery/{mediaId}/likes/{likeId}`: Stores likes for gallery items, writable by authenticated users.
 * - `/gallery/{mediaId}/comments/{commentId}`: Stores comments for gallery items, writable by authenticated users, deletable by the comment owner or admin.
 * - `/users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}`: Stores user-specific bookmarks of gallery items, writable only by the user.
 * - `/suggestions/{suggestionId}`: Stores member suggestions, writable by authenticated users, and readable/updatable by admins.
 * - `/resources/{resourceId}`: Stores downloadable resources, readable by authenticated users and writable by admins.
 * - `/announcements/{announcementId}`: Stores general announcements, publicly readable and admin-writable.
 * - `/notifications/{notificationId}`: Stores site-wide notifications, readable by authenticated users and writable by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: Admin privileges are granted by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection. This ensures secure and auditable admin role assignment via the Admin SDK.
 * - User Ownership: Enforces strict ownership for user profiles and bookmarks, preventing unauthorized data access or modification.
 * - Public Read with Restricted Writes: Applies to events, services, gallery media, and announcements, allowing public access while restricting modifications to admins.
 * - No User Listing: Listing all users is disallowed to prevent information harvesting.
 * - Self-Creation: Users can only create their own profile document using their authenticated UID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `createdByAdminId` field on `/events/{eventId}`, `/gallery/{mediaId}`, `/resources/{resourceId}`, and `/announcements/{announcementId}` documents is used to quickly check if the creator is an admin.

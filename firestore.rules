/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control system with public read access to certain collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Grants admin privileges.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores service details.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores service booking inquiries.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}: Stores gallery media items.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for gallery items.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for gallery items.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}: Stores user-specific bookmarks of gallery items.
 * - /suggestions/{suggestionId}: Stores member suggestions.
 * - /resources/{resourceId}: Stores downloadable resources.
 * - /announcements/{announcementId}: Stores general announcements.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for 'events', 'services', 'gallery', and 'announcements' collections.
 * - Admin-only write access for 'events', 'services', 'gallery', 'resources', and 'announcements' collections.
 * - User-owned data is stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Admin privileges are granted by the existence of a document in `/roles_admin/{userId}`.
 * - Bookings and ContactInquiries are publicly creatable, but only admins can read or update them.
 * - Likes and Comments are writable by authenticated users. Comments can be deleted by the owner or an admin.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events documents should have a `createdByAdminId` field to simplify admin-only write rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Publicly readable data is stored in top-level collections ('events', 'services', 'gallery').

/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset implements a role-based access control system with public read access to published events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event information. Published events are publicly readable. Only admins can create, update, or delete events. Each event document must contain a `createdByAdminId` field indicating the admin who created it.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles. Each user can only read and update their own profile.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Documents in this collection indicate admin privileges. If a document exists for a user ID, that user is considered an admin.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to the `events` collection for documents where the `published` field is true.
 * - Only authenticated admins can create, update, or delete events.
 * - Users can only read and update their own user profiles.
 * - Listing of all users is not permitted.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `events` documents require the `createdByAdminId` field, which is used for authorization to restrict write access to admins only.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Published events are differentiated using the `published` boolean field within each document in the `events` collection.

/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control system with public read access to certain collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Grants admin privileges.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Stores service details.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores service booking inquiries.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}: Stores gallery media items.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/likes/{likeId}: Stores likes for gallery items.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/comments/{commentId}: Stores comments for gallery items.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}: Stores user-specific bookmarks.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 * - Public Read Access: The `events`, `services`, and `gallery` collections are publicly readable.
 * - Owner-Only Access: User profiles and bookmarks are accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - Bookings and Contacts: Allow public creation of booking and contact documents; admin only access to view and update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events include a `createdByAdminId` field for write access control.
 * - GalleryMedia includes a `createdByAdminId` field for write access control.

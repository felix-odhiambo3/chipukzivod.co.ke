/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a tiered security model for the Chipukizi Hub application, 
 * with public read access to certain collections (e.g., 'events', 'services', 'gallery', 'announcements'), 
 * restricted user-specific data access (e.g., 'users', 'bookmarks'), and admin-only write access to sensitive collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Top-level collections: 'events', 'services', 'bookings', 'contacts', 'gallery', 'suggestions', 'resources', 'announcements'.
 * - User-specific subcollections: '/users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}'.
 * - Admin role is determined by the presence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for 'events', 'services', 'gallery', and 'announcements'.
 * - Bookings and Contacts are publicly creatable but readable only by admins.
 * - Only admins can create/update/delete 'events', 'services', 'gallery', 'suggestions', 'resources', and 'announcements'.
 * - Users can only manage their own bookmarks under /users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}.
 * - Users can create likes and comments for gallery media, and delete only their own comments.
 * - Listing of user documents is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Event documents contain a `createdByAdminId` to simplify admin-only write access rules.

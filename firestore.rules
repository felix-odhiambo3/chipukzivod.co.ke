/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chipukizi Hub.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes security and data ownership, enforcing strict
 * access controls based on user roles and document ownership. It leverages
 * Firebase Authentication to verify user identity and authorization. Public
 * read access is granted to published events, while other data is secured
 * based on user roles and ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for published events.
 * - Admin-only write access for events.
 * - User-owned profiles with admin read override.
 * - Role-based admin privileges via document existence.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events store `createdByAdminId` to simplify ownership checks.

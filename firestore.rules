/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a hybrid security model, balancing open read access for public content with restricted write access for administrative control and user-specific data ownership.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Events, readable by all, created/updated/deleted only by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, readable by the user themselves, not listable.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Admin role assignments. The existence of a document grants admin access.
 * - /services/{serviceId}: Services offered, publicly readable, admin-writable.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Service booking inquiries. Public can create, admins can read/update.
 * - /contacts/{contactId}: Contact form submissions. Public can create, admins can read/update.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}: Gallery media items, publicly readable, admin-writable.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/likes/{likeId}: Likes for gallery items, created/deleted by users.
 * - /gallery/{mediaId}/comments/{commentId}: Comments on gallery items, created by users, deletable by owner/admin.
 * - /users/{userId}/bookmarks/{bookmarkId}: User-specific bookmarks, managed by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role: Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 * - Public Read Access: Collections like `/events`, `/services`, and `/gallery` are publicly readable to allow open access to content.
 * - User Data Ownership: User-specific data (e.g., bookmarks) is secured using the `isOwner(userId)` helper function, ensuring that only the user can modify their own data.
 * - Denormalization: For simplicity and performance, data required for authorization (e.g., `createdByAdminId` in `/events`) is denormalized directly onto the documents. This avoids costly `get()` calls in the rules.

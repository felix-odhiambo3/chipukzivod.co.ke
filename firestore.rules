/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Chipukizi Hub.
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model
 *  where admins have broad access and authenticated users have limited access to specific data.
 *  Public read access is granted to certain collections like `events`, `services`, and `gallery`.
 * @data_structure Data is organized into top-level collections such as `events`, `users`,
 * `services`, `bookings`, `contacts`, `gallery`, `suggestions`, and `resources`.
 *  User-specific data like bookmarks are stored in subcollections under `/users/{userId}`.
 * @key_security_decisions
 *  - Events: Publicly readable, but only admins can create, update, or delete them.
 *  - Users: Users can only read their own profile. Admins can read all user profiles.
 *  - Bookings and ContactInquiries: Publicly creatable, but only admins can read or update them.
 *  - Gallery: Publicly readable and admin writable.
 *  - Suggestions: User-creatable, admin-readable/updatable.
 *  - Resources: User-readable, admin-writable.
 *  - No user listing is allowed (except for admins, not yet implemented in these rules).
 * @denormalization Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in the
 * `roles_admin/{userId}` collection.

/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with public read access to published events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access for 'published' events, restricted writes to admins.
 * - User-level read access for user profiles, admin read access for all profiles.
 * - Admin privileges granted by the presence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events have a `createdByAdminId` field to link them to the admin who created them, enabling admin-only write access.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - The `status` field segregates 'published' and 'draft' events. Public read access is granted based on the `status` field being 'published'.

/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Chipukizi Hub
 *
 * @core_philosophy This ruleset enforces a role-based access control system where administrators can create, update, and delete events.
 * Users can only view published events. User profiles are private and only accessible to the user themselves and admins. Admin privileges
 * are determined by the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection.
 *
 * @data_structure
 * - `/events/{eventId}`: Stores event data, including metadata like `createdByAdminId` and `published`.
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profile data.
 * - `/roles_admin/{uid}`: Indicates admin privileges; document existence grants admin rights.
 *
 * @key_security_decisions
 * - Events have a `published` field to control visibility.
 * - Only admins (users with a document in `/roles_admin/{uid}`) can create, update, or delete events.
 * - Users can only read their own profile data in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 *
 * @denormalization_for_authorization
 * - Events store the `createdByAdminId` to allow event modifications to be checked against the creating admin without additional reads.

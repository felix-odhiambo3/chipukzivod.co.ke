/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset implements a role-based access control model with public read access to published events.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to published events.
 * - Admin-only write access for events.
 * - User-owned profiles with admin read access.
 * - Admin role is determined by the existence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}.

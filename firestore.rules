/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Chipukizi Hub.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a hybrid security model, blending role-based access control for administrative functions with user-ownership for individual profiles.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event information. Publicly readable, but only admins can modify.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Each user can only manage their own profile.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges. The existence of a document at this path grants admin rights.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Events are publicly readable to encourage discovery. Admin privileges are required for creation, modification, and deletion.
 * - Users can only manage their own profiles, preventing unauthorized access to other user's data.
 * - Listing of users or admin roles is explicitly denied.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Events include a `createdByAdminId` field to simplify admin-only write rules.
